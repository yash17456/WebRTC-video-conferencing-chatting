Greetings Omo,

Hope you are safe and healthy, I am a current Grad student at the University of Southern California pursuing my Master's in Computer Science, I am currently in my final semester and would be graduating in December 2020 and applied to the New Grad Software Engineer position at Stripe. After reading the job description I believe that my skill set might make me a really good fit for this position and wanted to share my resume and profile directly with you hoping that you find my profile interesting and can give me a referral.
